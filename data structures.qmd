## Objectives

- Basic data types in R

- Data with factors

- `class()` and converting variables

- Vector and Matrix fun

- Practice exercises


## Basic data types in R

- Concept of "Data Objects"

- Data you can use is in the Global Environment 

- Data Type refers to the kind of data (important for computers)

- Data Type is determined automatically in R (by the passive-aggressive Butler)

- You often will need and want to tweak data type

## Basic primitive types in R

```
a <- 1    # numeric
mode(a)
a <- "1"  # character
mode(a)
a <- '1'  # character
mode(a)
a <- TRUE # logical
mode(a)
a <-  1i # complex
mode(a)
```
## Basic data types in R

- NULL means undefined value (absence of a vector)
  + is.null() function can check it

- NA means missing value (not available)
  + is.na()

- inf means infinity e.g. 1/0 of -1/0
  + is.infinite()
- NaN means an invalid number e.g. 0/0
  + is.nan()

## Basic data types in R

```
my_list <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
my_list <- my_list$c  # Element 'c' doesn't exist, Output: NULL

na_addition  <- 5 + NA
print(na_addition)  # Output: NA


```
## Basic data types in R

There are some rules for naming data objects

- Can contain letters, numbers, some symbolic characters

- Begin with a letter, Does not contain spaces

- Some things are forbidden, `@`, `%`, `#`, etc.

- Should be human-readable, consistent, and not too long

## Basic data types in R


```
x1 <- 5  

x2 <- "It was a dark and stormy night" 

# hard to read
my_variable_9283467 <- 1 

```


## Data with factors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Let's say you want to analyse categorical data.

Sometimes this is called a "factor".
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
# Boxplot of Sepal.Length by Species from iris using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Length by Species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Sepal Length") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a1c9f4", "#ffb482", "#8de5a1"))
```

## Data with factors

Two types of factors

- Non-ordered factors : the levels are the names of the categories
**cows** = Martha, Ruth, Edith

- Ordered factors: have a specific order
**dose** = Control < Half < Full

## class() and converting variables

```

# non-ordered factor
variety <- c("short", "short", "short",
             "early", "early", "early",
             "hybrid", "hybrid", "hybrid")
         

```

## Vector and Matrix fun

Ways of organizing data

<br>

- Vector - Homogeneous and One dimensional from 1 to i, `my_vec[i]`

- Matrix - Two dimensions rows, columns, `my_mat[i, j]`

- Array - Generalized matrix with n dimensions, `my_array[i, j, k]`

## Vector and Matrix fun

```
# Vectors

myvec1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5) 
myvec1
class(myvec1) 

myvec2 <- as.character(myvec1) 

```

## Vector and Matrix fun

```
vec1 <- 1:16 
vec1 

mat1 <- matrix(data = vec1, 
               ncol = 4, 
               byrow = FALSE) 
```

## Lists
Unlike vectors and matrices, lists can hold elements of different types. Each element in a list can be a vector, matrix, data frame, or even another list
```
# Creating a list
my_list <- list(name="John", age=25, scores=c(90, 85, 88))
print(my_list)
```
You can access elements in a list using the $ operator or double square brackets [[]].

# Dataframes
Dataframes are a special type of list that is used to store data.
They are similar to matrices, but can hold elements of different types. 
```
# Creating a data frame
my_data_frame <- data.frame(name=c("John", "Jane", "Jim"), age=c(25, 30, 35), scores=c(90, 85, 88))
print(my_data_frame)
```

You can access elements in a data frame using the $ operator or double square brackets [[]].

# Arrays
Arrays are a special type of data structure that is used to store data in multiple dimensions.
They are similar to matrices, but can hold elements of different types.
```
# Creating an array
my_array <- array(data = 1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))
print(my_array)
```

You can access elements in an array using the [,,] operator.
```
# Accessing an element in an array
my_array[1, 1, 1]
```
# practice exercises
1. Create a vector of the numbers 1 to 10.
```
# Creating a vector
my_vector <- 1:10
print(my_vector)
```   
2. Create a matrix of the numbers 1 to 12, with 3 rows and 4 columns.
```
# Creating a matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
print(my_matrix)
```
3. Create an array of the numbers 1 to 24, with 2 rows, 3 columns, and 4 layers.
```
# Creating an array
my_array <- array(data = 1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))
print(my_array)
``` 
4. Access the element in the first row, first column, first layer of the array.
```
# Accessing an element in an array
my_array[1, 1, 1]
```
5. Change the element in the first row, first column, first layer of the array to 100.
```
# Changing an element in an array
my_array[1, 1, 1] <- 100
print(my_array)
```
6. Create a list of the numbers 1 to 10.
```
# Creating a list
my_list <- list(1:10)
print(my_list)
```
7. Create a data frame of the numbers 1 to 12, with 3 rows and 4 columns.
```
# Creating a data frame
my_data_frame <- data.frame(1:12)
print(my_data_frame)
```
8. Create an array of the numbers 1 to 24, with 2 rows, 3 columns, and 4 layers.
```
# Creating an array
my_array <- array(data = 1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))
print(my_array)
```
9. Access the element in the first row, first column, first layer of the array.
```
# Accessing an element in an array
my_array[1, 1, 1]
```
10. Access the element in the first row, first column, first layer of the array.
```
# Accessing an element in an array
my_array[1, 1, 1]
```
11. store dataframes inside a list
```
# Creating a list
my_list <- list(my_data_frame)
print(my_list)
```
